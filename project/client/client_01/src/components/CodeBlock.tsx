// This file is no longer needed as react-markdown handles code blocks.
// It can be safely deleted.
// If you have specific custom styling or functionality for code blocks
// that react-markdown doesn't cover, you might re-introduce this
// as a custom component for react-markdown's `components` prop.
// For now, we'll rely on remark-gfm and basic styling.
